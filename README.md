CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION:
Project Summary
This project identifies fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. It combines XGBoost for prediction, SMOTE to handle class imbalance, and SHAP for model explainability.

Libraries Used
pandas, numpy,scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn,xgboost,seaborn, matplotlib,shap

Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Fraud Detection
File Used: fraudTrain.csv

Steps to Run
Install required packages:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn xgboost shap seaborn matplotlib
Place fraudTrain.csv in your working directory.
Run the script in your IDE / Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab.

Derived features: age, amt_per_pop, merchant_distance
Label encoded: merchant, category, gender, job, city, state

 Model
Model: XGBoostClassifier
Handling Imbalance: SMOTE
Scaling: StandardScaler
